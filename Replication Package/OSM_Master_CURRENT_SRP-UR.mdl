		which for individuals with HUD is 4.84 times that of Rx OUD. This is \
		consistent with both TEDS and prior NSDUH data that show significantly \
		higher rates of treatment engagement from individuals with HUD vs OUD. \
		Because that data is based on receipt rather than seeking, this assumes \
		that the barriers faced by Rx OUD vs HUD do not differ in their relative \
		magnitude or effect. This assumption is also made in the barrier variables \
		in the model. [Source: NSDUH 2019]

Adjust to change the extrapolation of each exogenous input series. Modify to set final values for each extrapolation and final times at which those values are reached. To view each combined exogenous input and extrapolation, use the rightmost column with the Graph tool. To override and hold constant at final data values instead, turn the Switch for Constant Projections to 1.

Policy levers are operationalized as % changes to the relevant parameter or input time series. All levers have the same absolute directionality, i.e. positive values increase the parameter or time series while negative values decrease it. For variables with a 0-1 probability range, a policy change of -1 means 0% probability and a policy change of 1 means 100% probability. Levers can be adjusted in combination with different magnitudes and directions, as appropriate, to test policies with multiple effects or to test multiple simultaneous policies. All policy levers take effect at the same time, specified using the Policy Activation Time slider (default 2020). The default is a 1-year ramp for implementation.
